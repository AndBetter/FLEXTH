If you are not familiar with python/conda these steps can be used as an example to 
set up a conda environment from scratch to use FLEXTH:



1. download and install miniconda (light version of conda)
   (https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html)



2. open the conda command prompt and run: 

  >>> conda config --add channels conda-forge 
  >>> conda config --set channel_priority strict



3. from the conda command prompt install mamba

  >>> conda install mamba



4. install spider 

  >>> mamba install spyder



5. create a suitable environment named "myenv" where to use FLEXTH

  >>> mamba create -n myenv python=3.12 numpy scipy xarray rasterio astropy opencv gdal scikit-image spyder-kernels



6. run spyder from the base environment

  >>> spyder


7. open the script and change the spyder kernel to the one corresponding to the new environment:

  go to: tools>preferences>python interpreter; choose " use the following python interpreter" and browse to python.exe 
  inside the folder where the new environment was created (e.g. : " C:\Users\Tom\miniconda3\envs\python_312\python.exe")


8. done
