Wherever you like create two folders named Input and Output

Compulsory (DTM, flood delineation) and optional (water bodies, exclusion mask)
rasters should be placed in the Input folder

In the script assign the appropriate paths to the Input/Output folders

Adjust the parameters if you like. 

Run the script. 

The geotiff raster with estimated water depths (in cm) will be created in the Output folder.

Open with a GIS and possibly adjust the limits of the displayed  values (e.g. between 0 and 200 cm),
add transparency to "0" values. Permanent water bodies (if provided) will be displayed with a dummy 999 water depth
