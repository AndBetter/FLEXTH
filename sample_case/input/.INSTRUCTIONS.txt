Wherever you like create two folders named Input and Output

Compulsory (DTM, flood delineation) and optional (water bodies, exclusion mask)
rasters should be placed in the Input folder.

The DTM for the sample case can be downloaded at the link provided in the DTM.txt file. 

In the script FLEXTH.py assign the appropriate paths to the Input/Output folders

Adjust the mode parameters (if you feel like). 

Run the script. 

The geotiff raster with estimated water depths (in cm) and water level (in m) will be created in the Output folder.

Open with a GIS and possibly adjust the limits of the displayed  values (e.g. between 0 and 200 cm for the water depth),
add transparency to "0" values. Permanent water bodies (if provided) will be displayed with a dummy 999 water depth.
